# accelerator-base-containers

Base containers for various heterogeneous accelerators and their respective runtimes

## Overview

This project aims to provide a range of multi-arch base containers that support pre-configured runtimes for various
heterogeneous accelerators.

Containers are published on Docker Hub under the `acceleratorbase` namespace:

| Image | Path | Architecture(s) | Description |
|-------|------|-----------------|-------------|
| `acceleratorbase/ncs2-rpi` | [intel-ncs2/ncs2-rpi] | arm64 | OpenVINO runtime for the Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 running on a Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 (raspbian) |
| `acceleratorbase/edgetpu-std` | [edgetpu/edgetpu-std] | amd64, arm64 | EdgeTPU runtime running at standard clock speed |
| `acceleratorbase/edgetpu-max` | [edgetpu/edgetpu-max] | amd64, arm64 | EdgeTPU runtime running at maximum clock speed |
